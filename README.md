## Supervised Learning - Foundations

[ReCell](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_ReCell.ipynb)
Built a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone/tablet and identify factors that significantly influence it.

***

## Supervised Learning - Classification

[ReCell](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_INN_Hotels.ipynb)
Analyzed data to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, built a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

## Ensemble Techniques

[ReCell](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_EasyVisa.ipynb)
Facilitated the process of visa approvals, comparing and contrasting multiple models to recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.

## Model Tuning

[ReCell](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_ReneWind.ipynb)
Built various classification models and tuned them to find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generators could be repaired before failing/breaking to reduce the overall maintenance cost.

## Unsupervised Learning

[ReCell](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_Trade%26Ahead.ipynb)
Grouped stocks based on the attributes provided, and shared insights about the characteristics of each group.
